        <h2>Seriously, what more do you want?</h2>
        <p>PyRadials, an open-source and hobby project by Adam Bonner, revolutionizes surveying drawing with a mit-licensed software platform. Import data from Leica and other devices, convert to OSGB36 coordinates and then draft precise AutoCAD-compatible drawings. PyRadials is still in development, with plans for blocks, linetypes, a what3words integration, viewports etc. It will always be free to use, with the source code hosted publically. PyRadials seeks to offer a lightweight, free versatile solution for efficient survey data management and project visualization.</p>
        <h3>Instrument Support</h3>
        <p>One of PyRadials' standout features is its capability to seamlessly import and process data from multiple sources, including Leica TPS1100 series .gsi files and GPS coordinates from a .CSV file (e.g. from a Trimble TSC3 device). Leveraging lots of maths and python modules it reduces "coded" cartesian OSGB36 coordinates (Easting, Northing) from polar observations (Hz, Vt, Sd).</p>
        <h3>DXF Export Engine</h3>
        <p>The software's versatility extends to its drafting engine, powered by the EZDXF library, enabling the creation of intricate 3D labelled drawings compatible with AutoCAD. From delineating walls and surface changes to plotting spot levels, PyRadials supports a wide range of codes and layers, facilitating detailed topographical and measured building surveys at multiple scales.</p>
        <h3>Roadmap</h3>
        <p>Furthermore, PyRadials is poised to expand its capabilities with planned integrations like what3words (simplifying locating a station), block support (think trees and toilet icons), and DTM rendering. The aim is to cater to a diverse portfolio of surveying needs.</p>
        <h2>It's Open Source</h2>
        <p>PyRadials stands out in its commitment to democratizing survey drawing creation, offering a powerful alternative to proprietary software with its open-source framework. PyRadials is released under the MIT license, ensuring accessibility for professionals seeking efficient surveying solutions.</p>
        <h3>I'm interested! what's the catch?</h3>
        <p>PyRadials adopts a "free to use, paid support" model, ensuring accessibility while providing avenues for users to obtain assistance and guidance as needed. I'd love you to raise a PR, but if you just need a feature, get in touch and you can prioritise my backlog! Frequent updates are expected in the coming weeks and months.</p>
